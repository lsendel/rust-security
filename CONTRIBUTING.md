# Contributing to Rust Security Platform

We welcome contributions from the community! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Rust Security Platform project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Rust 1.75+** installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Docker and Docker Compose** for local development
- **Git** for version control
- **Basic knowledge** of Rust, security concepts, and OAuth 2.0

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rust-security-platform.git
   cd rust-security-platform
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup/quick-start.sh
   # Select option 1 for developer mode
   ```
4. **Verify the setup**:
   ```bash
   cargo test --all-features
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
   ```

## Contributing Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clear, maintainable code following Rust best practices
- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Update relevant documentation
- Follow our security guidelines (see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md))

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run the full test suite
cargo test --all-features

# Run security checks
cargo audit
cargo deny check

# Run formatting and linting
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add OAuth PKCE support for mobile apps"
git commit -m "fix: resolve JWT validation edge case"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation for token endpoint"
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request
- Push your branch to your fork
- Create a pull request against the `main` branch
- Provide a clear description of your changes
- Reference any related issues

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Rust Best Practices**: Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees
- **Error Handling**: Use proper error types and context
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive doc comments for public APIs
- **Testing**: Maintain high test coverage with unit and integration tests

### Security Requirements

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **PII Protection**: Use the PII redaction utilities for logs and errors
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets or credentials
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly
- **Threat Modeling**: Consider security implications of changes

### Documentation Standards

- **API Documentation**: Use Rust doc comments (`///`) for all public APIs
- **README Files**: Update relevant README files for new features
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document significant architectural changes
- **Security Documentation**: Update security guides for security-related changes
