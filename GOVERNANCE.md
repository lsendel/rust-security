# 🏛️ Rust Security Project Governance Charter

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: January 2025  
**Next Review**: July 2025

## 🎯 Mission Statement

The Rust Security project aims to build the world's most secure, performant, and developer-friendly OAuth 2.0 platform. We are committed to transparent governance, inclusive community participation, and technical excellence.

## 📋 Governance Principles

### 🌟 Core Values
- **Security First**: Security is our highest priority in all decisions
- **Developer Experience**: Simplicity and ease of use guide our design
- **Transparency**: All decisions and processes are public and documented

### ⚖️ Decision-Making Philosophy
- **Consensus-driven**: We prefer consensus but can make executive decisions when needed
- **Data-informed**: Decisions are backed by user feedback, metrics, and technical analysis
