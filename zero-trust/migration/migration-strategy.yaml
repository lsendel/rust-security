    # Zero-Trust Migration Strategy
    
    ## Overview
    This document outlines the phased approach to migrate from the current authentication service architecture to a comprehensive zero-trust security model.
    
    ## Migration Phases
    
    ### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
    **Objective**: Establish zero-trust infrastructure without disrupting existing services
    
    #### Steps:
    1. **Deploy Infrastructure**
       - Create zero-trust namespaces
       - Install Istio service mesh in permissive mode
       - Deploy SPIRE server and agents
       - Set up OPA policy engine
    
    2. **Monitoring Setup**
       - Deploy Falco for runtime security monitoring
       - Configure Prometheus for zero-trust metrics
       - Set up alerting for security events
    
    3. **Validation**
       - Verify all components are healthy
       - Test SPIFFE identity issuance
       - Validate OPA policy evaluation
    
    #### Success Criteria:
    - [ ] All zero-trust components deployed and healthy
    - [ ] SPIFFE identities being issued to workloads
    - [ ] OPA policies loading successfully
    - [ ] Security monitoring active
    
    ### Phase 2: Service Mesh Integration (Week 3-4)
    **Objective**: Integrate existing services with service mesh while maintaining functionality
    
    #### Steps:
    1. **Sidecar Injection**
       - Enable Istio sidecar injection for rust-security namespace
       - Redeploy services with sidecars
       - Verify service-to-service communication
    
    2. **mTLS Enablement**
       - Configure PeerAuthentication in PERMISSIVE mode
       - Validate mTLS certificate exchange
       - Monitor for any connectivity issues
    
    3. **Traffic Management**
       - Deploy VirtualServices and DestinationRules
       - Configure load balancing and circuit breaking
       - Test failover scenarios
    
    #### Success Criteria:
    - [ ] All services have Istio sidecars
    - [ ] mTLS working in permissive mode
    - [ ] Service discovery functioning
    - [ ] No service disruptions
    
    ### Phase 3: Identity and Access Controls (Week 5-6)
    **Objective**: Implement identity-based access controls and device trust
    
    #### Steps:
    1. **SPIFFE Identity Integration**
       - Configure ClusterSPIFFEID resources
       - Update applications to use SPIFFE workload API
       - Implement identity-based authentication
    
    2. **Device Trust Service**
       - Deploy device trust assessment service
       - Implement device fingerprinting
       - Configure trust scoring algorithms
    
    3. **Policy Enforcement**
       - Deploy fine-grained authorization policies
       - Implement device trust requirements
       - Configure risk-based access controls
    
    #### Success Criteria:
    - [ ] SPIFFE identities integrated in applications
    - [ ] Device trust assessment working
    - [ ] Authorization policies enforcing correctly
    - [ ] Risk-based access controls active
    
    ### Phase 4: Zero-Trust Enforcement (Week 7-8)
    **Objective**: Enable strict zero-trust enforcement
    
    #### Steps:
    1. **Strict mTLS**
       - Change PeerAuthentication to STRICT mode
       - Verify all communications are encrypted
       - Monitor for any failures
    
    2. **Policy Enforcement**
       - Enable strict policy enforcement
       - Implement continuous verification
       - Configure automated remediation
    
    3. **Gateway Security**
       - Deploy zero-trust ingress gateway
       - Implement WAF and rate limiting
       - Configure threat detection
    
    #### Success Criteria:
    - [ ] All traffic encrypted with mTLS
    - [ ] Strict policy enforcement active
    - [ ] Continuous verification working
    - [ ] Zero-trust gateway operational
    
    ### Phase 5: Optimization and Hardening (Week 9-10)
    **Objective**: Optimize performance and enhance security posture
    
    #### Steps:
    1. **Performance Optimization**
       - Tune resource allocations
       - Optimize policy evaluation
       - Configure caching strategies
    
    2. **Security Hardening**
       - Implement advanced threat detection
       - Configure security automation
       - Enhance monitoring and alerting
    
    3. **Compliance Validation**
       - Run compliance scans
       - Generate security reports
       - Document security posture
    
    #### Success Criteria:
    - [ ] Performance benchmarks met
    - [ ] Advanced threat detection active
    - [ ] Compliance requirements satisfied
    - [ ] Documentation complete
    
    ## Rollback Strategy
    
    ### Quick Rollback (Emergency)
    1. Change Istio to permissive mode
    2. Disable strict policy enforcement
    3. Route traffic to original services
    4. Investigate and fix issues
    
    ### Gradual Rollback
    1. Reduce traffic to zero-trust services
    2. Disable policy enforcement gradually
    3. Remove zero-trust configurations
    4. Clean up infrastructure
    
    ## Risk Mitigation
    
    ### High Priority Risks
    1. **Service Outage**
       - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment strategy
       - Monitoring: Real-time health checks
       - Response: Automated rollback triggers
    
    2. **Performance Degradation**
       - Mitigation: Resource pre-allocation
       - Monitoring: Latency and throughput metrics
       - Response: Auto-scaling configurations
    
    3. **Security Policy Conflicts**
       - Mitigation: Policy validation in staging
       - Monitoring: Policy evaluation metrics
       - Response: Policy exemption procedures
