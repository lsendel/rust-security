# Zero-Trust Architecture Implementation

This directory contains a complete zero-trust architecture implementation for the Rust authentication service.

## Architecture Overview

The zero-trust implementation includes:

1. **Service Mesh (Istio)**: Secure communication with mTLS
2. **Identity-Centric Access**: SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity
3. **Policy Engine**: OPA for fine-grained authorization
4. **Network Segmentation**: Micro-segmentation with Cilium
5. **Continuous Verification**: Runtime monitoring and attestation
6. **Device Trust**: Device fingerprinting and assessment
7. **Gateway Security**: Zero-trust ingress and egress
8. **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability

## Deployment Order

1. Deploy foundational infrastructure
2. Install service mesh and identity providers
3. Configure security policies
4. Deploy applications with zero-trust configurations
5. Enable monitoring and observability
6. Run migration scripts

## Migration Strategy

The implementation includes a phased migration approach:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure setup
- Phase 2: Service mesh deployment
- Phase 3: Policy enforcement
- Phase 4: Full zero-trust activation

See `migration/` directory for detailed migration plans.
