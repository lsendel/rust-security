# Security Best Practices for Rust Security Platform Examples

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the example applications and serves as a guide for developers using this authentication platform.

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

All examples in this repository follow enterprise-grade security patterns and demonstrate proper implementation of defensive security measures. These examples are suitable for production use when configured properly.

## üìã Security Features Implemented

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Security
- **Secure Secret Management**: JWT secrets must be provided via environment variables
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable token expiry with maximum 7-day limit
- **Enhanced Validation**: Clock skew tolerance, expiration validation, and nbf (not before) checks
- **Secure Algorithms**: Uses HMAC-SHA256 with minimum 32-character secrets

```rust
// ‚úÖ Secure JWT service initialization
let jwt_service = JwtService::from_env()?; // Requires JWT_SECRET_KEY env var

// ‚ùå Never do this in production
let jwt_service = JwtService::new("hardcoded-secret".to_string(), None)?;
```

#### Password Security
- **Strength Validation**: Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements
- **Secure Hashing**: BCrypt with configurable cost (minimum 10, recommended 12)
- **Common Pattern Detection**: Prevents use of common passwords
- **Timing Attack Protection**: Constant-time verification

```rust
// Password requirements:
// - Minimum 12 characters
// - At least 3 of: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters  
// - No common patterns (password, 123456, qwerty, admin)
let hashed = PasswordService::hash_password("SecureP@ssw0rd123")?;
```

### üöß Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

- **Configurable Rate Limits**: Environment-based configuration
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- **Request Body Limits**: 1MB default maximum
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error responses with retry headers

### üåê Web Security Headers

All HTTP responses include comprehensive security headers:

```rust
// Implemented security headers:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; [...]
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### üîí Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Comprehensive Validation**: Custom validators for all input types
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **SCIM Filter Validation**: Secure SCIM filter parsing
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**: Input encoding and CSP headers

## üìö Example Applications Security Guide

### Axum Integration Example

**Location**: `/examples/axum-integration-example/`

**Security Features**:
- ‚úÖ Environment-based configuration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive authentication middleware  
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚úÖ Request/response logging
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown handling
- ‚úÖ TLS support (optional)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting middleware
- ‚úÖ Input validation

**Production Deployment**:
```bash
# Required environment variables
export JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-256-bit-secret-key-here"
export BCRYPT_COST="12"
export BIND_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8080"  # Use 0.0.0.0 only if behind firewall
export ENVIRONMENT="production"

# Optional security configuration
export JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS="24"
export RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE="100"

# Run with security profile
cargo run --profile security --features full
```

### Simple Auth Client Example  

**Location**: `/examples/simple-auth-client/`

**Security Features**:
- ‚úÖ Environment-based credential management
- ‚úÖ Secure HTTP client configuration
- ‚úÖ Error handling without information leakage
- ‚úÖ Connection validation
- ‚úÖ Token introspection

**Usage**:
```bash
# Production usage with environment variables
export CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export AUTH_SERVICE_URL="https://your-auth-service.com"

cargo run --example simple-auth-client
```

## üîß Configuration Security

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description | Security Note |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | JWT signing secret | Min 32 chars, high entropy |
| `TOKEN_BINDING_SALT` | Recommended | Token binding salt | Random 32+ chars |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Yes | OAuth client ID | Non-sensitive |
| `CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | OAuth client secret | High entropy, rotate regularly |
| `BCRYPT_COST` | No | BCrypt work factor | 10-15 range |
| `BIND_ADDR` | No | Server bind address | Use 127.0.0.1 for single host |

### Feature Flags Security

The examples use feature flags to enable/disable security components:

```toml
# Production-ready defaults
default = ["auth", "security", "validation"]

# Security feature combinations
web-security = ["security", "auth-advanced", "rate-limiting", "validation"]
production = ["tls", "monitoring", "compression", "connection-pooling"]
full = ["production", "database", "integrations", "docs", "web-security"]
```

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying any example to production, ensure:

### ‚úÖ Authentication
- [ ] JWT secrets are loaded from environment variables
- [ ] Token expiration is configured appropriately (‚â§ 7 days)
- [ ] Password requirements meet organizational policy
- [ ] BCrypt cost is set to minimum 10 (recommended 12)

### ‚úÖ Network Security  
- [ ] TLS/HTTPS is enabled for production
- [ ] Bind address is configured securely (avoid 0.0.0.0 unless behind firewall)
- [ ] CORS policies are configured for your domains
- [ ] Security headers are enabled

### ‚úÖ Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Request body size limits are appropriate
- [ ] File upload restrictions are in place (if applicable)

### ‚úÖ Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are monitored
- [ ] Rate limiting violations are tracked
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### ‚úÖ Deployment Security
- [ ] Secrets are managed via secure secret management system
- [ ] Database connections use TLS
- [ ] Redis connections use TLS (if applicable)
- [ ] Container security scanning is enabled

## üîç Security Testing

Each example includes comprehensive test suites:

```bash
# Run security-focused tests
cargo test --features security
cargo test --features full

# Run with enhanced security profile
cargo test --profile security

# Property-based security testing
cargo test --features property-testing
```
