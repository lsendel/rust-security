'''# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture of the Rust Security project.

## Workspace Structure

The project is structured as a Cargo workspace, which allows for a modular design with multiple crates. The main crates in the workspace are:

- `auth-service`: This is the core service of the application. It provides a comprehensive authentication and authorization service with a rich set of security features.

- `common`: This crate contains shared code and utilities that are used by other crates in the workspace. This includes common data structures, error handling, cryptographic functions, and configuration management.

- `mvp-tools`: This crate contains tools and utilities that were used for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development. Its role in the current architecture should be reviewed.

## Key Architectural Principles

- **Modularity:** The workspace is divided into crates with distinct responsibilities, which promotes code reuse and maintainability.

- **Security by Default:** The project follows a "secure by default" philosophy. This is reflected in the use of strict linting rules (e.g., `forbid(unsafe_code)`), dependency auditing, and a focus on secure coding practices.

- **Configuration Driven:** The application is highly configurable, with settings managed through a combination of configuration files and environment variables. This allows for flexibility in different deployment environments.

- **Observability:** The project includes built-in support for observability, with features for logging, metrics, and tracing. This is essential for monitoring the health and security of the application.

## Future Development

This document is a living document and should be updated as the architecture of the project evolves. Future work may include:

- A more detailed breakdown of the modules within the `auth-service` crate.
- A diagram illustrating the interactions between the different services and components.
- A description of the data flow and data models used in the application.
