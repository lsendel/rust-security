# API Reference

The Rust Security Platform provides a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs for authentication, authorization, user management, and security monitoring. These APIs are designed with security, performance, and usability in mind.

## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](overview.md) - Introduction to the API design principles and core concepts
2. [Authentication](authentication.md) - OAuth 2.0 flows, token management, and OpenID Connect endpoints
3. [Authorization](authorization.md) - Policy evaluation, access control decisions, and policy management
4. [User Management](user-management.md) - User accounts, groups, MFA, and session management
5. [Token Management](token-management.md) - Token introspection, revocation, and administration
6. [Examples](examples.md) - Practical integration examples and best practices

## Key Features

### Security First
All APIs follow security best practices with:
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect compliance
- JWT-based token authentication
- Rate limiting and threat detection
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance Optimized
Built for high performance with:
- Sub-50ms response times
- Efficient caching strategies
- Connection pooling support
- Streaming for large data transfers

### Developer Friendly
Designed for ease of integration with:
- RESTful design principles
- Comprehensive error handling
- Multiple authentication methods
- Official SDKs for popular languages

## Getting Started

To begin using the APIs:

1. Register an OAuth client in the admin console
2. Obtain an access token using one of the OAuth flows
3. Use the access token to make authenticated requests
4. Handle rate limiting and error responses appropriately

Each API section provides detailed endpoint documentation with request/response examples, error codes, and integration patterns.
