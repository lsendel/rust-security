## 🔐 Pre-Deployment Security Validation

### ✅ **Phase 1: Code Security Verification**

#### **1.1 Static Code Analysis**
- [ ] **Cargo Audit**: `cargo audit` passes with zero vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Dependency Check**: All dependencies are up-to-date and maintained
- [ ] **Security Lints**: `cargo clippy` passes with security-focused lints
- [ ] **Unsafe Code**: Confirm `unsafe_code = "forbid"` is enforced workspace-wide
- [ ] **Code Review**: All security-critical code reviewed by security team

```bash
# Commands to verify
cargo audit
cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo check --workspace --all-features
```

#### **1.2 Secrets and Credentials**
- [ ] **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Verify no secrets in source code or configuration files
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data loaded from secure environment variables
- [ ] **Key Rotation**: JWT signing keys and encryption keys are unique per environment
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: Integration with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager confirmed

```bash

git log --all --grep="password\|secret\|key" --oneline
rg -i "password|secret|key" --type rust src/
```

#### **1.3 Build Security**
- [ ] **Security Profile**: Build using `--profile security` for production

# Verify JWT secret strength
openssl rand -base64 32  # Generate strong secret
```

#### **3.2 Input Validation & Sanitization**
- [ ] **Request Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection and rate limiting active
- [ ] **Request Size Limits**: Maximum request size configured
- [ ] **CORS Configuration**: Strict CORS policies in place
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers

```rust
// Verify security headers
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

#### **3.3 Monitoring & Logging**
- [ ] **Security Monitoring**: Security events logged and monitored
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All authentication events logged
- [ ] **Log Security**: Logs don't contain sensitive information
- [ ] **Alerting**: Critical security alerts configured
- [ ] **SIEM Integration**: Security logs forwarded to SIEM system

```bash
# Verify logging configuration
RUST_LOG="warn,auth_service=info,security=debug"
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

---

### ✅ **Phase 4: Operational Security**

#### **4.1 Secrets Management**
