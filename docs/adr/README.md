# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Rust Security Platform project.

## ADR Process

### What is an ADR?
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made in the project. They explain the context, the decision made, and the consequences of that decision.

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR when you make an architectural decision that:
- Has significant impact on the system's structure or behavior
- Involves trade-offs between different technical approaches
- Affects multiple components or services
- Has long-term implications for development or operations
- Might be questioned or need explanation in the future

### ADR Template
Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short descriptive title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the architectural issue or problem that needs to be solved]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision and why this particular solution was chosen]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context after applying the decision, including positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered
[List other options that were considered and why they were rejected]

## Related ADRs
[List any related ADRs]
```

### Naming Convention
- ADRs are numbered sequentially: ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.
- Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate the decision
- File naming: `ADR-XXXX-short-title.md`

### Review Process
1. Create ADR as "Proposed"
2. Share with team for review
3. Incorporate feedback
4. Mark as "Accepted" when consensus is reached
5. Update status to "Deprecated" or "Superseded" when decisions change
