## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```
main              # Production-ready code, protected
├── develop       # Integration branch for features
├── feature/*     # Feature development branches
├── hotfix/*      # Critical fixes for production
└── security/*    # Security-focused branches (priority)
```

### Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**
   ```bash
   # Triggered automatically on PR
   - Security scan (cargo audit, semgrep, trivy)
   - Code quality (clippy, rustfmt)
   - Test suite (unit, integration, property-based)
   - Performance regression testing
   - Dependency license compliance
   ```

2. **Manual Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Security implications assessed
   - [ ] Performance impact evaluated
   - [ ] Breaking changes documented
   - [ ] Tests provide adequate coverage
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Threat model implications considered

3. **Security-Critical Reviews**
   ```bash
   # Additional requirements for security-sensitive changes
   - Two security team approvals required
   - Threat model impact analysis
   - Security testing completed
   - Documentation updated
   ```

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rust-security-platform
cd rust-security-platform

# Setup development environment
./scripts/setup/quick-start.sh
# Select option 1 for developer mode

# Install additional maintainer tools
cargo install cargo-audit cargo-deny cargo-geiger
cargo install cargo-criterion cargo-llvm-cov
pip install semgrep safety
```

### Code Quality Standards

```toml
# Enforced via workspace Cargo.toml
[workspace.lints]
rust.unused_crate_dependencies = "warn"
rust.unused_imports = "warn"
rust.dead_code = "warn"
rust.unsafe_code = "forbid"
clippy.all = "warn"
clippy.pedantic = "warn"
clippy.cargo = "warn"
clippy.nursery = "warn"
```

## 🔒 Security Management

### Security Incident Response

1. **Critical Vulnerability Response (< 24 hours)**
   ```bash
   # Immediate actions
   1. Assess impact and scope
   2. Create private security advisory
   3. Develop and test fix
   4. Coordinate disclosure timeline
   5. Prepare security release
   ```

2. **Security Advisory Process**
   ```bash
   # GitHub Security Advisory workflow
   1. Create private advisory
   2. Assign CVE if applicable
   3. Coordinate with security team
   4. Prepare coordinated disclosure
   5. Release security update
   ```

### Threat Model Maintenance

```bash
# Monthly threat model review
./scripts/security/threat-model-review.sh

# Quarterly comprehensive assessment
./scripts/security/comprehensive-security-assessment.sh

# Update threat documentation
vim docs/security/threat-models/
```

### Security Scanning & Monitoring

```bash
# Daily security checks (automated)
cargo audit                          # Vulnerability scanning
cargo deny check                     # Policy compliance
semgrep --config=security-audit .    # SAST scanning
trivy fs .                          # Container scanning

# Weekly comprehensive scan
./scripts/security/comprehensive-security-scan.sh

# Generate security report
./scripts/security/generate-security-report.sh
```

## 📦 Dependency Management

### Automated Dependency Updates

The platform uses Dependabot for automated dependency management:

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml configuration includes:
- Security updates (immediate)
- Patch updates (weekly) 
- Minor updates (weekly, with conditions)
- Major updates (manual review required)
```

### Manual Dependency Review Process

1. **Security Updates (Priority)**
   ```bash
   # Review security advisory
   cargo audit --json | jq '.vulnerabilities.found[]'
   
   # Test security update
   cargo update --package <vulnerable-package>
   cargo test --all-features
   
   # Validate fix
   cargo audit
   ```

2. **Major Version Updates**
   ```bash
   # Impact assessment
   ./scripts/dependency-impact-analysis.sh <package>
   
   # Breaking changes review
   cargo tree --duplicates
   cargo test --all-features
   
   # Performance impact
   cargo criterion --baseline before-update
   ```

### Supply Chain Security

```bash
# Supply chain monitoring
cargo supply-chain analyze           # Dependency analysis
cargo tree --format "{p} {r}"       # Repository analysis

# License compliance
cargo license --json > licenses.json
./scripts/security/license-compliance-check.sh

# SBOM generation
cargo cyclonedx --format json --output-pattern target/sbom-{name}-{version}.json
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests with coverage
   cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info
   
   # Property-based testing
   cargo test --all-features proptest
   
   # Mutation testing (optional)
   cargo mutants
   ```

2. **Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Integration test suite
   cargo test --test '*integration*' --all-features
   
   # End-to-end testing
   ./scripts/testing/end_to_end_system_test.sh
   
   # Security testing
   ./scripts/testing/test_security_scenarios.sh
   ```

3. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   # Benchmark suite
   cargo criterion
   
   # Load testing
   ./scripts/testing/comprehensive_load_test.sh
   
   # Performance regression testing
   ./scripts/performance/performance-regression-check.sh
   ```

### Quality Gates

```bash
# Pre-commit quality checks
1. Code formatting (rustfmt)
2. Linting (clippy with deny warnings)
3. Security scan (cargo audit)
4. Test suite execution
5. Documentation generation

# CI/CD quality gates  
1. Comprehensive test suite
2. Security vulnerability scan
3. Performance regression check
4. License compliance verification
5. Container security scan
```

## 🚢 Release Management
