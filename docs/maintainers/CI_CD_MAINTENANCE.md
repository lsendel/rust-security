## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

### Current Workflow Structure

```
.github/workflows/
├── main-ci.yml                    # Primary CI/CD pipeline
├── comprehensive-testing.yml      # Comprehensive test suite
├── enhanced-deployment.yml        # Production deployment
├── performance-monitoring.yml     # Performance regression testing
├── security-monitoring.yml        # Advanced security scanning
├── dependency-update.yml          # Dependency management
├── dependency-auto-merge.yml      # Automated dependency merging
└── legacy workflows/              # Older workflows (to be deprecated)
```

### Pipeline Dependencies

```yaml
# Workflow execution order and dependencies
1. Pre-checks (paths-filter, validation)
2. Build & Test Matrix (parallel)
3. Security Scanning (parallel with testing)
4. Performance Testing (after build)
5. Integration Testing (after build & security)
6. Container Build & Scan (after tests pass)
7. Deployment (after all checks pass)
8. Post-deployment monitoring
```

## 🔧 Workflow Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Weekly Tasks

```bash
# Review workflow performance metrics
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs --jq '.workflow_runs[0:10] | .[] | {name: .name, status: .status, duration: .run_duration_ms}'

# Check for failed workflow runs
gh run list --status failure --limit 20

# Review cache hit rates
# Check in Actions tab > Caches section

# Update action versions (automated via Dependabot)
# Review and approve Dependabot PRs for GitHub Actions
```

#### Monthly Tasks

```bash
# Comprehensive workflow audit
./scripts/ci-cd/audit-workflows.sh

# Performance baseline review
./scripts/ci-cd/analyze-workflow-performance.sh

# Cleanup old artifacts and caches
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/artifacts --jq '.artifacts[] | select(.created_at < "2024-01-01") | .id' | xargs -I {} gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/artifacts/{} -X DELETE

# Review runner usage and costs
./scripts/ci-cd/runner-cost-analysis.sh
```

#### Quarterly Tasks

```bash
# Major workflow optimization review
# Update to latest GitHub Actions features
# Review and update security scanning tools
# Benchmark against industry best practices
```

### Workflow Configuration Management

#### Environment Variables

```yaml
# Global environment variables (set in repository settings)
CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always
RUST_VERSION: stable
RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings

# Security thresholds
SECURITY_THRESHOLD_HIGH: 0
SECURITY_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM: 3
SECURITY_THRESHOLD_LOW: 10

# Performance thresholds
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD: 1.1  # 10% regression threshold
```

#### Secrets Management

```bash
# Required repository secrets
GITHUB_TOKEN                    # Automatic (no action needed)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID              # For AWS deployments
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY          # For AWS deployments
SNYK_TOKEN                     # For enhanced security scanning
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL              # For notifications
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN               # For container registry access

# Validate secrets exist
gh secret list

# Update secrets
gh secret set SECRET_NAME < secret_file.txt
```

### Adding New Workflows

#### Workflow Template

```yaml
name: New Workflow Template

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  security-events: write

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

jobs:
  template-job:
    name: Template Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2

      - name: Run template task
        run: echo "Template workflow executed"
```

#### Workflow Validation

```bash
# Validate workflow syntax
gh workflow view --yaml workflow-name

# Test workflow locally (using act)
act -W .github/workflows/new-workflow.yml

# Dry run workflow
gh workflow run new-workflow.yml --ref feature-branch
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Cache Strategy Optimization

#### Current Caching Structure

```yaml
# Rust dependency caching
- uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
  with:
    key: ${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.rust }}-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
    shared-key: "security-scan"  # For cross-workflow sharing

# Docker layer caching
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

#### Cache Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Analyze cache hit rates
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/cache/usage

# Cache cleanup automation
./scripts/ci-cd/cleanup-old-caches.sh

# Cache performance reporting
./scripts/ci-cd/cache-performance-report.sh
```

### Workflow Parallelization

#### Optimized Job Dependencies

```yaml
# Parallel execution strategy
jobs:
  pre-checks:
    # Quick validation jobs
    
  build-matrix:
    needs: pre-checks
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        rust: [stable, beta]
      fail-fast: false
    # Parallel builds across matrix
    
  security-scan:
    needs: pre-checks
    # Run in parallel with build
    
  integration-tests:
    needs: [build-matrix, security-scan]
    # Wait for both build and security
```

### Runner Optimization

#### Self-Hosted Runners (if applicable)

```bash
# Setup self-hosted runner
# Download runner
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz

# Configure runner
./config.sh --url https://github.com/OWNER/REPO --token TOKEN

# Install as service
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

#### Resource Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor runner resource usage
./scripts/ci-cd/monitor-runner-resources.sh

# Optimize job resource allocation
# Update timeout values based on historical data
```

## 🔒 Security Pipeline Management

### Security Scanning Workflow Maintenance

pip install --upgrade semgrep

# Cargo audit
cargo install cargo-audit --force

# Update tool versions in workflows
sed -i 's/trivy:0.46.0/trivy:0.47.0/g' .github/workflows/security-monitoring.yml
```

#### Security Policy Updates

```yaml
# Update security thresholds based on risk tolerance
env:
  SECURITY_THRESHOLD_HIGH: 0      # No high severity issues
  SECURITY_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM: 3    # Max 3 medium severity issues  
  SECURITY_THRESHOLD_LOW: 10      # Max 10 low severity issues
```

#### SARIF Integration

```yaml
# Ensure SARIF results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- name: Upload SARIF results
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    sarif_file: security-results.sarif
```

### Dependency Security Automation

#### Dependabot Configuration

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml

updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "cargo"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    groups:
      critical-security-updates:
        patterns: ["*security*", "*crypto*"]
        update-types: ["security-update"]
```

#### Auto-merge Security Updates

```bash
# Monitor auto-merge effectiveness
gh pr list --label "auto-merged" --state closed --limit 20

# Review failed auto-merges
gh pr list --label "auto-merge-failed" --state open

# Adjust auto-merge criteria
vim .github/workflows/dependency-auto-merge.yml
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Pipeline Issues

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Dependency resolution issues
Problem: Cargo.lock conflicts
Solution: 
  - cargo clean
  - cargo update
  - Commit new Cargo.lock

# Compilation errors  
Problem: Rust version incompatibility
Solution:
  - Update rust-toolchain.toml
  - Update CI Rust version
  - Test locally with same version
```

#### Test Failures

```bash
# Flaky tests
Problem: Non-deterministic test failures
Solution:
  - Identify flaky tests: ./scripts/testing/identify-flaky-tests.sh
  - Add retries or fix race conditions
  - Use --test-threads=1 for problematic tests

# Database connectivity
Problem: Integration tests failing due to DB connection
Solution:
  - Check service health in workflow
  - Add connection retry logic
  - Verify service configuration
```

#### Performance Issues

```bash
# Slow workflow execution
Problem: Workflows taking too long
Diagnosis:
  - Review workflow timing: gh run view RUN_ID
  - Identify bottlenecks: ./scripts/ci-cd/workflow-performance-analysis.sh
  
Solutions:
  - Optimize cache strategy
  - Parallelize independent jobs
  - Use faster runners
  - Reduce test scope for PR validation
```
