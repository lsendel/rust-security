# Threat Model

Comprehensive threat modeling for the Rust Security Platform using the STRIDE methodology.

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive threat model for the Rust Security Platform using the STRIDE methodology. The model identifies potential threats across all system components and provides corresponding mitigation strategies.

## Next Steps

To address identified threats:

1. **Implement Missing Controls**: Deploy any security controls not yet implemented
2. **Regular Assessments**: Conduct periodic threat modeling updates
3. **Security Testing**: Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing
4. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Improve threat detection and response capabilities
5. **Training and Awareness**: Ensure teams understand security requirements
