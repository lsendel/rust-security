## Security Principles

The Rust Security Platform is built on these core security principles:

### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls throughout the technology stack to protect against various attack vectors.

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
Never trust, always verify. All access requests are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.

### 3. Security by Design
Security controls are integrated into the platform from the ground up, not added as an afterthought.

### 4. Least Privilege
Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions.

### 5. Fail Secure
The system defaults to a secure state when errors occur or security controls fail.

## Key Security Features

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect compliant
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, WebAuthn, SMS)
- PKCE enforcement for public clients
- Token binding and replay attack prevention

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Policy-based authorization with Cedar
- Fine-grained permission controls

### Cryptography
- Industry-standard encryption algorithms
- Secure key management and rotation
- Post-quantum cryptography readiness
- Hardware security module (HSM) integration

### Monitoring
- Real-time threat detection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Behavioral analytics
- Automated incident response

## Getting Started

If you're new to the security aspects of the platform:

1. **Read the Security Overview** to understand the security architecture
2. **Review the Threat Model** to understand potential attack vectors
3. **Follow Security Best Practices** for implementation guidance
4. **Implement Security Monitoring** for ongoing protection

## For Security Teams

If you're responsible for security operations:

1. **Configure Security Monitoring** for your environment
2. **Implement Incident Response Procedures**
3. **Review Compliance Documentation** for audit readiness
4. **Conduct Security Testing** to validate controls

## For Developers

If you're integrating with or extending the platform:

1. **Follow Secure Coding Practices**
2. **Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization**
3. **Use Cryptographic Libraries Correctly**
4. **Log Security Events Appropriately**
