## ðŸ”§ **Production Configuration**

### **Environment Variables Required**
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/auth_prod
REDIS_URL=redis://redis-cluster:6379

# Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-key>
CSRF_SECRET=<secure-random-key>

# External Services
PROMETHEUS_URL=http://prometheus:9090
GRAFANA_URL=http://grafana:3000

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
ENABLE_METRICS=true
```

### **Resource Requirements**
```yaml
# Minimum Production Resources
auth-service:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "500m"

policy-service:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
```

---

## ðŸ“Š **Monitoring & Observability**

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Token generation/validation latency
- Policy evaluation performance
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Error rates and types

### **Alerting Thresholds**
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 100ms (P95)
- Memory usage > 80%
- CPU usage > 70%
- Failed authentication attempts > 10/minute

---

## ðŸ”’ **Security Hardening**

### **Network Security**
- [ ] TLS 1.3 enforced
- [ ] Network policies restricting pod-to-pod communication
- [ ] Ingress controller with WAF enabled
- [ ] DDoS protection configured

### **Application Security**
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection verified
- [ ] XSS protection headers configured
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting per IP and user

### **Container Security**
- [ ] Non-root user in containers
- [ ] Read-only root filesystem
- [ ] Security contexts configured
- [ ] Image vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Container signing with Cosign

---

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Process**

### **Blue-Green Deployment Steps**
1. Deploy to green environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Gradually shift traffic (10%, 50%, 100%)
4. Monitor metrics and error rates
5. Rollback if issues detected

### **Rollback Plan**
- Automated rollback triggers
- Database migration rollback scripts
- Configuration rollback procedures
- Communication plan for incidents

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Post-Deployment Validation**

### **Immediate Checks (0-15 minutes)**
- [ ] All pods running and healthy
- [ ] Health check endpoints responding
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] Basic authentication flow working

### **Short-term Monitoring (15 minutes - 2 hours)**
- [ ] No error rate spikes
- [ ] Response times within SLA
- [ ] Memory/CPU usage stable
- [ ] No security alerts triggered

### **Long-term Monitoring (2+ hours)**
- [ ] Performance metrics trending normally
- [ ] No gradual resource leaks
- [ ] Audit logs being generated correctly
- [ ] Backup processes running successfully

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

### **Performance Targets**
- Authentication latency: P95 < 50ms
- Policy evaluation: P95 < 10ms
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Error rate: < 0.1%

### **Security Targets**
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- All security headers present
- Audit trail completeness: 100%
- Incident response time: < 5 minutes

---

## ðŸ“ž **Emergency Contacts & Procedures**

### **Escalation Path**
1. **Level 1**: Development team (immediate response)
2. **Level 2**: Security team (< 15 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: Management (< 30 minutes)

### **Emergency Procedures**
- Incident response playbook location
- Emergency rollback commands
- Security incident response plan
- Communication templates
