## Best Practices

### Maintenance Best Practices

1. **Always test maintenance procedures** in staging before production
2. **Schedule maintenance during low-traffic periods**
3. **Have rollback procedures ready** for all changes
4. **Document all maintenance activities** for audit trails
5. **Monitor system behavior** after maintenance activities

### Automation Best Practices

1. **Use infrastructure as code** for all deployments
2. **Implement canary deployments** for high-risk changes
3. **Automate rollback procedures** alongside deployments
4. **Use feature flags** for gradual rollout of changes
5. **Monitor deployment metrics** and success rates

### Security Best Practices

1. **Apply security patches** within 24 hours of release
2. **Use principle of least privilege** for all maintenance access
3. **Encrypt sensitive data** in backups and logs
4. **Regularly rotate credentials** and certificates
5. **Conduct security audits** before major changes

### Performance Best Practices

1. **Monitor performance impact** of maintenance activities
2. **Use resource limits** to prevent maintenance from affecting production
3. **Implement maintenance windows** with automated notifications
4. **Test maintenance procedures** under load conditions
5. **Document performance baselines** before and after maintenance

This maintenance procedures guide ensures the Rust Security Platform remains secure, performant, and reliable through comprehensive automation and documented procedures.
