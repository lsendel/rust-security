# E2E Test Plan Strategy

## Test Coverage Matrix

| Component | API Tests | UI Tests | Integration | Coverage Target |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Authentication | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 95% |
| Authorization | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 90% |
| User Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 85% |
| Security Features | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 100% |

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. Smoke Tests (Critical Path)
- Authentication flow
- Basic API endpoints
- Core UI functionality
- **Runtime**: < 5 minutes

### 2. Regression Tests (Full Suite)
- All API endpoints
- Complete UI workflows
- Cross-browser testing
- **Runtime**: < 30 minutes

### 3. Security Tests (Compliance)
- Input validation
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization checks
- **Runtime**: < 15 minutes

## Reporting Structure

### Real-time Dashboard
- Live test execution status
- Coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Failure analysis

### Test Reports
- HTML reports with screenshots
- JUnit XML for CI integration
- Coverage reports with gaps
- Performance metrics

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Criteria | Action on Failure |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Smoke | 100% pass | Block deployment |
| Coverage | >85% | Warning + review |
| Performance | <2s response | Investigation |
| Security | 100% pass | Block deployment |

## Execution Schedule

- **Pre-commit**: Smoke tests
- **PR**: Regression suite
- **Nightly**: Full security scan
- **Release**: Complete validation
