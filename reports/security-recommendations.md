- **High**: 4 issues  
- **Medium**: 2 issues
- **Low**: 2 issues

## Immediate Actions Required

### Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
- [ ] Fix: URL and redirect URI validation
- [ ] Fix: Secure random number generation

### High Priority Issues (Fix This Week)
- [ ] Address: Client authentication validation
- [ ] Address: Role-based access control in SCIM
- [ ] Address: Per-IP rate limiting
- [ ] Address: Authentication failure logging

### Medium Priority Issues (Fix This Month)
- [ ] Improve: TOTP verification with time window
- [ ] Improve: Structured logging format
