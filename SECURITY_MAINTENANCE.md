# Security Maintenance Guide

## 🔒 Security Status: RESOLVED

All critical security issues from GitHub code scanning have been addressed as of 2024-08-24.

## ✅ Completed Security Fixes

### High Priority Issues (Fixed)
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Updated `validator` 0.18→0.19 to fix idna vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2024-0421)
- **Code Quality**: Fixed all unused variable warnings across test files
- **Metadata Compliance**: Added missing Cargo.toml package metadata
- **Private Key Exposure**: Verified no actual private keys were exposed

### Verified Safe Items
- **JWT Tokens in Tests**: Confirmed these are test fixtures, not real secrets
- **Test Data**: All hardcoded tokens are legitimate test data for validation

## ⚠️ Remaining Low-Risk Items

### Upstream Dependencies (No Action Needed)
- **RSA Marvin Attack** (RUSTSEC-2023-0071): Affects SQLx dependency chain, no fix available
- **Unmaintained Crates**: Some transitive dependencies are unmaintained but pose minimal risk

## 🛡️ Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
```bash
# Update dependencies and check for vulnerabilities
cargo update
cargo audit

# Run security-focused clippy checks
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Check for new GitHub security advisories
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/security-advisories
```

### Quarterly Tasks
- Review and update all direct dependencies
- Audit third-party integrations
- Review access controls and permissions
- Update security documentation

### Security Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Quick security audit
cargo audit --deny warnings

# Check for exposed secrets (if you have additional tools)
git secrets --scan

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
cargo deny check advisories
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

- [x] All high/critical vulnerabilities resolved
- [x] Dependency vulnerabilities patched where possible
- [x] Code quality warnings addressed
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in production code
- [x] Proper error handling for security-sensitive operations
- [x] Input validation and sanitization in place

## 🔄 Automation Recommendations

Consider setting up:
1. **GitHub Actions** for automated security scanning
2. **Dependabot** for automatic dependency updates
3. **CodeQL** analysis for continuous security monitoring
4. **Pre-commit hooks** for security checks

## 📞 Incident Response

If new security issues are discovered:
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Apply fixes following this same methodology
3. Update this maintenance guide
4. Notify stakeholders if needed
