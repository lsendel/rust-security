## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of the codebase, **Rust Security Workspace** is a production-ready, enterprise-grade authentication and authorization platform that provides comprehensive security infrastructure for modern applications. The platform consists of three main services built with Rust, focusing on OAuth2/OIDC authentication, Cedar-based authorization, and secure integration patterns.

## Detected Features

### Implemented
- **OAuth2/OIDC Authentication**: Complete implementation with client credentials and refresh token flows
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: TOTP support with Argon2-hashed backup codes
- **Token Management**: Secure JWT generation, validation, introspection, and revocation
- **Authorization Engine**: Cedar-based policy engine for attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- **SCIM Integration**: System for Cross-domain Identity Management with filtering and pagination
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-client rate limiting with sliding windows
- **Token Binding**: Prevents token theft by binding tokens to client characteristics
- **Request Signing**: HMAC-SHA256 request signing for critical operations
- **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks and malicious input
- **Audit Logging**: Structured audit logs for security events
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for external dependencies
- **Google OAuth Integration**: OAuth2 integration with Google Identity Platform
- **Health Monitoring**: Kubernetes-ready health endpoints with Prometheus metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry support for observability
- **Container Support**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment manifests

### In Progress
- **PKCE Support**: Proof Key for Code Exchange implementation (partially complete)
- **Advanced SCIM Features**: Extended SCIM operations and schema validation

### Planned (from TODOs/Issues)
- **Additional OAuth Providers**: Support for more identity providers
- **Advanced Cedar Policies**: More complex policy templates and validation
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching layers and query optimization

## Technology Analysis

### Current Stack
- **Language**: Rust 1.70+ with Tokio async runtime
- **Web Framework**: Axum 0.7 with tower middleware
- **Authentication**: JWT with RS256 signing, OAuth2/OIDC
- **Authorization**: AWS Cedar policy engine
- **Storage**: Redis for production, in-memory for development
- **Cryptography**: Argon2 for password hashing, RSA for JWT signing
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with security policies
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger with utoipa

### Code Patterns Observed
- **Architecture**: Microservices with clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests with 95%+ coverage
- **Code Style**: Clean Rust patterns with proper error handling and zero panics
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth with multiple security layers
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with validation
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with audit trails
