## 🚀 Deployment Confidence

### **Security Validation**
The system automatically validates security configuration before startup and **will refuse to start** if:
- JWT secrets are weak or missing
- Production environment lacks required security settings  
- Unsafe configurations are detected

### **Runtime Security**
- All authentication requires valid credentials (no bypasses)
- Session tokens are cryptographically secure and bound
- Error messages never leak sensitive information
- All security events are logged for monitoring

### **Operational Security**
- Configuration validates against security best practices
- Production mode enforces additional security requirements
- Fail-secure behavior for all error conditions

## 📋 Security Checklist for Operations

### **Pre-Deployment** ✅
- [ ] JWT_SECRET set to 64+ character secure string
- [ ] TOKEN_BINDING_SALT configured  
- [ ] MFA enabled for production
- [ ] CORS origins properly configured (no wildcards in production)
- [ ] All database connections secured

### **Post-Deployment** ✅
- [ ] Monitor security audit logs
- [ ] Verify no authentication bypasses
- [ ] Confirm error responses are sanitized
- [ ] Validate session security is working

### **Ongoing Security** 📅
- [ ] Regular security reviews (quarterly recommended)
- [ ] Monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Keep security configurations up to date
- [ ] Review audit logs for security events
