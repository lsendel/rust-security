# Rust Security Workspace – Project Analysis (2025-08-27)

This document provides an updated analysis of the repository as of 2025-08-27 (local). It complements README.md, quickstart.md, and SECURITY.md, and follows the Project Guidelines.

## 1. Workspace Overview
- Type: Cargo workspace (Rust 2021; workspace.rust-version=1.80)
- Core workspace members:
  - auth-core
  - auth-service (authentication, session mgmt, security logging, SOAR integration)
  - policy-service (policy evaluation/enforcement)
  - common (shared utilities, types)
  - api-contracts (API types)
  - compliance-tools (reporting, validations, metrics)
  - examples/axum-integration-example (example integration)
  - soar-integration, security-features (feature crates)
- Excluded from default workspace build: red-team-exercises, user-portal (TS/React), security-platform, input-validation, chaos-engineering, security-testing, tests.

## 2. Build/Tests Health Snapshot
- Recommended commands:
  - Build: `cargo build --workspace --all-features`
  - Tests: `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
  - Format/Lint: `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings`
- Notes:
  - Extensive test coverage in auth-service and examples; policy-service tests present (e.g., comprehensive_policy_test.rs, error_mapping_test.rs).
  - CI workflow file present: `.github/workflows/comprehensive-testing.yml` (ensure it runs workspace build + tests).

## 3. Dependencies & Security Posture
- Centralized versions under [workspace.dependencies] (Tokio 1.41, Axum 0.7, Hyper 1.x, SQLx without MySQL default-features, Validator 0.20, Reqwest 0.12, etc.).
- `rust.unsafe_code = "forbid"` and clippy pedantic/nursery enabled as warnings.
- SBOM files at root; supply-chain policy under `supply-chain-security.yml` and `deny.toml`.
- Security logging and metrics present in auth-service; Prometheus integration in services.

## 4. Architecture Highlights
- Auth Service: feature-flagged security modules (CSRF, TLS, secrets manager, session store, security logging/metrics, threat profiler with ML-like structure). Tests cover authorization flows, token binding, step-up auth, SCIM, health/introspect.
- Policy Service: metrics, error mapping, configuration; tests validate policy decisions and error mapping.
- Common: config, errors, utils; new modules for crypto utils, constants, rate limiter, redis config, and optimized pools.
- Examples: axum-integration-example with auth, repository, database modules and integration tests.
- Red-team exercises: TS/React dashboard including real-time alerts component (excluded from cargo workspace).

## 5. Risks & Recommendations
1. Ensure CI runs `cargo test --workspace --all-features` and `cargo clippy -D warnings` to prevent regressions.
2. Maintain strict logging hygiene (no secrets); continue to use anyhow/thiserror across crates.
3. Validate new modules (service_identity, non_human_monitoring, enhanced security metrics) have tests and are feature-gated if experimental.
4. Keep SQLx features limited to rustls and Postgres/SQLite (avoid MySQL unless RUSTSEC remediated).
5. Periodically run `cargo deny check` and update SBOMs for releases.

## 6. Next Steps for Contributors
- Build and test with the commands in Section 2.
- Follow Testing Guide and Security Hardening Guide for changes that affect external behavior.
- For red-team dashboard changes, use the subproject’s Node toolchain per its README.
