---

## 🗄️ **Phase 5: Intelligence Integration** ✅ COMPLETE

### Multi-source Vulnerability Intelligence
- **NVD**: National Vulnerability Database
- **RustSec**: Rust-specific security advisories
- **GitHub**: Security advisory database
- **OSV**: Open Source Vulnerabilities
- **CISA KEV**: Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

### Automated Synchronization
```bash
Daily Updates:
  - 50,000+ CVE records from NVD
  - Real-time RustSec advisories
  - GitHub security intelligence
  - CISA threat indicators
```

---

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Automated scanning with cargo-audit
2. **Supply Chain Policy**: License and policy compliance
3. **SAST Analysis**: Static application security testing
4. **Secret Detection**: Hardcoded credential scanning
5. **Container Security**: Docker and K8s configuration analysis
6. **Code Quality Security**: Unsafe code and security anti-patterns
7. **License Compliance**: Legal and regulatory compliance
8. **Kubernetes Security**: Policy and configuration validation

### Automated Test Execution
- **CI/CD Integration**: Every commit triggers security tests
- **Detailed Reporting**: JSON and Markdown test reports
- **Security Scoring**: Quantitative security assessment

---

## 🚨 **Phase 7: SIEM & Incident Response** ✅ COMPLETE

### Enterprise SIEM Integration
