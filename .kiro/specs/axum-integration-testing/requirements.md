# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature demonstrates comprehensive integration testing patterns for Axum REST APIs in Rust. The example will showcase best practices for testing HTTP endpoints with shared application state, proper async testing, and realistic CRUD operations using in-process testing without external dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete Axum application example with shared state, so that I can understand how to structure testable REST APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is created THEN it SHALL include a `create_app()` function in `src/lib.rs`
2. WHEN the application is initialized THEN it SHALL use shared state for managing users
3. WHEN routes are defined THEN they SHALL include GET /users, POST /users, and GET /users/:id endpoints
4. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL be easily testable without external dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests, so that I can verify my API endpoints work correctly end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL be located in `tests/integration.rs`
2. WHEN testing GET /users initially THEN the system SHALL return an empty list
3. WHEN testing POST /users with valid JSON THEN the system SHALL create a user and return 201 status
4. WHEN testing GET /users/:id for existing user THEN the system SHALL return the user data
5. WHEN testing GET /users/:id for non-existent user THEN the system SHALL return 404 status
6. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL use `tower::ServiceExt` and `oneshot` for in-process testing
7. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL use proper async testing with `tokio::test`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want realistic data models and error handling, so that the example reflects production-quality code patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining user models THEN they SHALL include proper serialization with serde
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL validate JSON input
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN responses are sent THEN they SHALL use proper JSON formatting
5. WHEN state is managed THEN it SHALL be thread-safe and suitable for concurrent access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear test organization and documentation, so that I can understand and extend the testing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL be well-organized with descriptive names
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL run independently without side effects
3. WHEN test setup is needed THEN it SHALL be reusable across test cases
4. WHEN assertions are made THEN they SHALL be comprehensive and clear
5. WHEN the example is complete THEN it SHALL include comments explaining key testing concepts
