# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Axum integration testing example with advanced production-ready features including additional REST endpoints, database persistence, authentication/authorization, OpenAPI documentation, and monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete CRUD operations, so that I can manage users with full create, read, update, and delete functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing PUT /users/:id THEN the system SHALL update existing users with validation
2. WHEN implementing DELETE /users/:id THEN the system SHALL remove users and return appropriate status
3. WHEN updating non-existent users THEN the system SHALL return 404 status
4. WHEN deleting non-existent users THEN the system SHALL return 404 status
5. WHEN performing updates THEN the system SHALL validate input data like creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database persistence, so that user data survives application restarts and can scale beyond memory limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring database THEN the system SHALL support both PostgreSQL and SQLite
2. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL automatically create required tables
3. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL persist data to the database
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use isolated test databases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication and authorization, so that I can secure API endpoints and control access to resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL support JWT tokens
2. WHEN accessing protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate authentication tokens
3. WHEN implementing authorization THEN the system SHALL support role-based access control
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
5. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want OpenAPI documentation, so that I can automatically generate API documentation and client SDKs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing OpenAPI THEN the system SHALL generate complete API documentation
2. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL serve interactive Swagger UI
3. WHEN defining endpoints THEN the system SHALL include request/response schemas
4. WHEN documenting authentication THEN the system SHALL include security schemes
5. WHEN generating docs THEN the system SHALL include error response examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want metrics and monitoring, so that I can observe application performance and health in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing metrics THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL track response times and status codes
3. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL increment error counters
5. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL provide observability data
