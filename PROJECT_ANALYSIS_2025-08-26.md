# Rust Security Workspace – Quick Project Analysis (2025-08-26)

This document provides a concise, actionable snapshot of the repository as of 2025-08-26 (local). It complements existing guides (README.md, SECURITY.md, quickstart.md) and aligns with the workspace guidelines.

## 1. Workspace Overview
- Type: Cargo workspace (Rust 2021, rust-version=1.80 in workspace.package)
- Core crates (members in Cargo.toml):
  - auth-core
  - auth-service (microservice providing auth/session/admin middleware, SOAR hooks)
  - policy-service (policy enforcement / Cedar)
  - common (shared utilities)
  - api-contracts (shared API types)
  - compliance-tools (supporting tooling)
  - examples/axum-integration-example (example integration)
- Excluded from workspace for builds by default: red-team-exercises, user-portal (TS/React), security-platform, input-validation, chaos-engineering, security-testing, tests (workspace-level tests live here but excluded from the workspace members list to keep default builds lean).

## 2. Build Health (current session)
- cargo build --workspace: SUCCESS (built with profiles and resolver=2)
- Not executed in this run: cargo test --workspace (tooling interface limits). Test files are present (auth-service, policy-service, workspace tests). See Section 5 for how to run locally.

## 3. Dependency and Security Posture
- Centralized [workspace.dependencies] with modern versions: axum 0.7, hyper 1.x, tokio 1.41.
- SQLx configured without MySQL default-features (notes reference RUSTSEC-2023-0071), using postgres/sqlite with rustls.
- idna pinned to >=1.0.3 to mitigate RUSTSEC-2024-0421.
- rust.unsafe_code = "forbid" in [workspace.lints]. Clippy pedantic/nursery/cargo enabled as warn.
- Supply chain metadata set in [workspace.metadata.security] with strict policy.

## 4. Features and Profiles
- Features organized in workspace metadata groups: core, standard, enterprise, experimental.
- Profiles tuned (release: lto=fat, panic=abort, codegen-units=1; test: opt-level=1).

## 5. How to Build and Test Locally
- Build all: cargo build --workspace --all-features
- Run all tests: cargo test --workspace --all-features
- Lint/format: cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings
- Optional: cargo deny check (if cargo-deny installed)
- Run services:
  - Auth Service: cargo run -p auth-service --bin auth-service
  - Policy Service: cargo run -p policy-service
  - Example: cargo run -p examples/axum-integration-example --example <name>

## 6. Observed Code/Test Layout (high level)
- auth-service/tests: multiple integration tests (e.g., authorization_it.rs, totp_it.rs, token_binding_it.rs) covering scopes, TOTP/MFA, token binding, health/introspect.
- policy-service/tests: comprehensive_policy_test.rs exercises policy decisions.
- benches present under auth-service/benches for performance and security performance.

## 7. Risks and Recommendations
- Ensure workspace-level tests under tests/ are regularly executed (they are excluded from workspace members, but cargo will still run them with cargo test --workspace if they are tied to a root crate; verify mapping). If tests don’t run, add a minimal root crate or integrate tests per Rust workspace conventions.
- Keep SBOM files (sbom.*) updated for releases.
- Maintain strict logging hygiene (no secrets) and consistent anyhow/thiserror patterns.
- Continue to avoid MySQL features in sqlx unless the RUSTSEC is definitively remediated.
- Validate WebAuthn/SAML and PQ crypto features remain behind feature flags and are covered by targeted tests.

## 8. Next Steps (Suggested)
1) Run full test suite locally and in CI: cargo test --workspace --all-features.
2) clippy with -D warnings to catch regressions.
3) Review compliance-tools outputs and monitoring integration (prometheus/opentelemetry) paths in services.
4) Periodic cargo audit/cargo deny and dependency updates under renovate.json processes.
