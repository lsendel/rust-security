# Security Assessment Report: OAuth Token Security Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on the analysis of the Salesloft Drift breach article and our codebase review, this report identifies current security posture and recommendations for preventing similar attacks in our authentication system.

## Key Vulnerabilities from Article

The Salesloft Drift breach highlighted critical issues:
1. **Long-lived OAuth tokens** with broad permissions
2. **Lack of behavioral monitoring** for non-human identities  
3. **No token rotation policies** for service accounts
4. **Static trust model** for AI agents and automation

## Current Security Strengths

Our authentication service has several protective measures already in place:

### 1. Token Security
- **Short token lifetimes**: Access tokens expire in 15 minutes (auth-service/src/config_secure.rs:262)
- **Refresh token limits**: 24-hour refresh token TTL
- **Token binding validation**: Prevents token theft and replay attacks
- **JWT secure implementation**: Using EdDSA algorithm with proper validation

### 2. Key Management
- **Automatic key rotation**: JWKS rotation every 30 days (auth-service/src/jwks_rotation.rs:29)
- **Key retention policy**: Old keys retained for 90 days for validation
- **Secure key storage**: Keys encrypted at rest with status tracking

### 3. Monitoring & Detection
- **Advanced threat profiling**: User behavior analysis with ML models (auth-service/src/threat_user_profiler/)
- **Anomaly detection**: Real-time behavioral anomaly detection
- **Security alerting**: Comprehensive alert system with severity levels (auth-service/src/security_monitoring.rs)
- **Risk scoring engine**: Dynamic risk assessment based on user patterns

### 4. Session Management
- **Redis-backed sessions**: Distributed session storage with expiration (auth-service/src/session_store.rs)
- **Session security features**: IP binding, user agent tracking, MFA status
- **Automatic cleanup**: Expired session removal

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Non-Human Identity Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current State**: 
- Basic API key store exists (auth-service/src/api_key_store.rs)
- No distinction between human and non-human identities
- Static permissions model

**Vulnerability**: AI agents and service accounts could maintain persistent access similar to Salesloft breach

### 2. Just-In-Time (JIT) Access Not Implemented
**Current State**:
- Fixed token lifetimes regardless of use case
- No dynamic permission scoping based on context

**Vulnerability**: Overly broad permissions for automated systems

### 3. Limited Service Account Monitoring
**Current State**:
- Threat profiling focused on human user patterns
- No specialized monitoring for API keys and service accounts

**Vulnerability**: Abnormal service account behavior could go undetected

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Within 1 Week)

1. **Implement Service Account Registry**
   - Create dedicated service account types
   - Enforce maximum token lifetime of 1 hour for service accounts
   - Require explicit scope declarations

2. **Enhanced API Key Security**
   - Add rate limiting per API key
   - Implement usage pattern monitoring
   - Add automatic revocation on anomaly detection

3. **Audit Existing Tokens**
   - Review all active sessions and tokens
   - Revoke any tokens older than 24 hours
   - Document all service accounts

### Short-term Improvements (1-4 Weeks)

1. **Just-In-Time Access System**
   ```rust
   // Proposed JIT token minting
   pub struct JitTokenRequest {
       identity: ServiceIdentity,
       requested_scopes: Vec<String>,
       justification: String,
       max_duration: Duration,
   }
   ```

2. **Service Account Behavioral Monitoring**
   - Extend threat profiler to track API key usage patterns
   - Implement baseline establishment for service accounts
   - Alert on deviations from normal patterns

3. **Zero Trust for Non-Human Identities**
   - Require continuous authentication for service accounts
   - Implement workload identity verification
   - Add cryptographic attestation for AI agents

### Long-term Enhancements (1-3 Months)

1. **Comprehensive Identity Governance**
   - Unified identity management for humans and machines
   - Automated access reviews
   - Privileged access management (PAM) integration

2. **Advanced Threat Detection**
   - Machine learning models specific to service account behavior
   - Cross-service correlation of suspicious activities
   - Integration with SOAR platform for automated response

3. **Compliance and Audit**
   - Immutable audit logs for all token operations
   - Compliance reporting for OAuth security standards
   - Regular security assessments

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Component | Risk Level | Implementation Effort | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| Service Account Registry | Critical | Medium | P0 |
| JIT Access | High | High | P1 |
| API Key Monitoring | High | Low | P0 |
| Behavioral Monitoring | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| Zero Trust Architecture | High | High | P2 |
| ML-based Detection | Medium | High | P2 |

## Security Configuration Updates

### Recommended Changes to auth-service/src/config_secure.rs

```rust
pub struct SecurityConfig {
    // Reduce from current values
    jwt_access_token_ttl_seconds: 300,  // 5 minutes (from 15)
    jwt_refresh_token_ttl_seconds: 3600, // 1 hour (from 24)
    
    // New configurations
    service_account_max_ttl_seconds: 3600, // 1 hour max
    require_jit_for_privileged_scopes: true,
    enable_continuous_auth_for_services: true,
}
```

## Monitoring Metrics to Implement

1. **Token Metrics**
   - Average token lifetime by identity type
   - Token refresh patterns
   - Failed authentication attempts per service

2. **Behavioral Metrics**
   - API calls per minute by service account
   - Geographic dispersion of service requests
   - Time-of-day usage patterns

3. **Security Metrics**
   - Time to detect anomalies
   - False positive rate for alerts
   - Mean time to revoke compromised tokens

## Conclusion

While our authentication service has strong foundational security features, the Salesloft breach highlights the critical need for enhanced non-human identity management. The most urgent priorities are:

1. Implementing strict controls for service accounts and API keys
2. Reducing token lifetimes further
3. Adding specialized monitoring for non-human identities

These improvements will significantly reduce our attack surface and align with zero-trust security principles for the age of autonomous AI agents.
